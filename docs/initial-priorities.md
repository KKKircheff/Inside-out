Development Priorities for Hackathon
Phase 1: Core MVP (Hours 1-8)

 Intelligence Layer (input evaluator)
 5 Core Analysis Agents
 Basic debate mechanics (2 rounds, fixed)
 Simple output with confidence score
 Minimal UI (form + results)

Phase 2: Sophistication (Hours 9-14)

 Moderator Agent with smart termination
 Add 3 Personality Agents (rotating selection)
 Research Layer integration
 Enhanced output formatting
 Improved UI with agent avatars

Phase 3: Polish (Hours 15-17)

 Add Chaos Agent (random appearance)
 Visual design (agent cards, animations)
 Pre-loaded demo examples
 Presentation deck
 Practice demo run


Demo Script for Presentation
[2 minutes total]
Setup (15s):
"We make bad decisions because no one challenges our thinking. Consultants charge thousands for this. We built an AI system that does it in 2 minutes."
Demo 1: Quick Decision (45s):

Input: "Should I quit my job to start a startup?"
Minimal context provided
Show Intelligence Layer asking for clarification OR doing research
Fast-forward to 9 agents debating
Show Moderator deciding to stop after Round 2
Result: Confidence score + blind spots

Demo 2: Complex Decision (45s):

Input: "Should we pivot our product strategy?" (with full context)
Show Research Layer gathering market data
Highlight specific agent interactions:

Risk Agent vs YOLO Agent tension
Chaos Agent random appearance


Show comprehensive report

Closing (15s):
"Adversarial AI that tears apart your ideas before reality does. Decision confidence, blind spots, better outcomes."

Evaluation Criteria Alignment
Innovation & Creativity (Target: 9/10)

✅ Adversarial multi-agent design is novel
✅ Personality agents add unexpected twist
✅ Chaos agent = memorable surprise

Technical Implementation (Target: 8/10)

✅ Sophisticated agent orchestration
✅ Smart termination via Moderator
✅ Research integration shows depth
✅ Real-time debate visualization

Impact & Scalability (Target: 9/10)

✅ Addresses universal problem (bad decisions)
✅ Clear monetization path (SaaS, API)
✅ Applicable across domains
✅ Actually useful (not just a demo)

Presentation (Target: 9/10)

✅ Entertaining (watching AI argue)
✅ Relatable problem
✅ Clear before/after value
✅ Visual design with agent personalities

Estimated Total: 35-37/40

Risk Mitigation
What Could Go Wrong:

Agents hallucinate/contradict research

Mitigation: Moderator validates consistency


Debate too long during demo

Mitigation: Hard 3-round cap, pre-run examples


Output too generic

Mitigation: Intelligence Layer ensures context


API costs spike

Mitigation: Parallel calls, cache common scenarios


Demo fails live

Mitigation: Have backup video, tested examples




Success Metrics
For Hackathon:

✅ Top 10 selection (internal voting)
✅ Judges remember the name ("Devil's Advocate")
✅ Audience laughs at agent interactions
✅ Someone asks "can I use this?"

Post-Hackathon:

Launch beta within 2 weeks
100 users test within month
Measure: decisions with tool vs. without (satisfaction survey)
