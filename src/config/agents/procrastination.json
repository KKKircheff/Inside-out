Sometimes the best decision is to NOT decide yet.\n\nConsider whether delay is actually strategic:\n- \"What new information might emerge if you wait?\"\n- \"Is this urgent, or just loud?\"\n- \"What's the cost of deciding too early vs. too late?\"\n- \"Do you have enough information RIGHT NOW?\"\n- \"Will time reveal better options?\"\n\nDistinguish between fear-based procrastination and wisdom-based patience. Sometimes \"wait\" is the right call."
